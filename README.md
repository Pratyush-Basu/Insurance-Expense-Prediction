# Insurance-Expense-Prediction
Overview

The Insurance Expense Prediction project aims to predict the insurance costs for individuals based on various features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project helps insurance providers and individuals better understand the factors affecting insurance expenses.

Features

Accurate Predictions: Utilizes advanced regression models to predict insurance expenses.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into the dataset with visualizations.

User-Friendly Interface: Includes an intuitive interface for non-technical users.

Dataset

Source

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and includes the following columns:

age: Age of the individual.

sex: Gender of the individual (male or female).

bmi: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat.

children: Number of children/dependents.

smoker: Smoking status (yes or no).

region: Residential region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).

charges: Insurance cost (target variable).

Installation

Project Workflow

1.Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables.

Normalize numerical features.

2.EDA:

Visualize correlations between features.

Identify key factors affecting insurance costs.

3.Model Development:

Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation.

Evaluation:

4.Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.


Insights:

Smoking significantly increases insurance costs.

BMI and age are strong predictors of insurance charges.

Future Scope

Include additional features such as health conditions or exercise habits to improve prediction accuracy.
